This plugin uses ad-hoc searches to find strings in files. For certain 
languages, it can also find variable/function/class definitions, 
function calls etc.

Other than |tags| or |cscope|, it doesn't build a database to speed up 
searches but always scans all files. It can make use of the following 
external tools in order to gain acceptable performance for medium-sized 
projects:

    - `git grep`
    - `ack` http://beyondgrep.com/
    - `ag` https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher
    - `sift` https://sift-tool.org/

The builtin vimscript-based version file scanner and also 
|vimgrep| are suitable for small projects. See |g:trag#grep_type| for 
available options.


Usage~

First, define which files belong to your project. See 
|g:trag#file_sources| for available sources. If the variable contains 
"vcs" and the current buffer is under control of a supported VCS, trag 
will scan the files in the VCS. Maybe your project's source files are 
already registered in your tags files, in which case those will be used.

Secondly, use |:Trag| to scan your project's files. You can restrict searches 
to certain "kinds" like only variable definitions or only function calls. See 
|trag-kinds| for details.

You can also type <Leader>r# to search for the word under cursor (see 
|g:trag_map_leader| and |TragInstallMap()| for details on maps). In 
supported filetypes, <Leader>rd will search for the definition of the 
word under cursor.

Currently the following filetypes are supported:

    - java
    - javascript
    - json
    - make
    - r
    - ruby
    - viki
    - vim

Run `:echo globpath(&rtp, 'ftplugin/*/trag.vim')` to get a full listing 
of supported filetypes.

NOTE: Some kinds are available only for a subset of known filetypes.

Default maps:

    <Leader>r# ... Trag the word under cursor
    <Leader>r. ... :Trag command-line
    <Leader>r+ ... Show quickfixlist via |:Tragcw|
    <Leader>r* ... Edit a file from the files list, i.e. the list that would be 
                   used if no "--file_sources" argument were passed to 
                   |:Trag|
    <Leader>rx ... The same as `:Trag -l -i=x -x=i <cword><cr>`
                   where x is a alphabetical letter that describes a kind in 
                   |g:trag_kinds| and <cword> is the word under cursor.
                   "-x=i" (exclude commented text) is only added if kind x is 
                   in |g:trag_kinds_ignored_comments|.
